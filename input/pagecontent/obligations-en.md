### Overview 

Obligations are a mean offered by HL7 FHIR to specify functional capabilities that defined actors MAY, SHOULD or SHALL to the data elements specified by the profiles.

We define three basic levels of compliance with the standard:
- L1 – unstructured document – ​​transmitted as necessary document metadata and a human-readable document in PDF format
- L2 – structured document divided into identifiable sections (entry examination, medical history, risk factors, medication, recommendations, …), the content is still kept only in textual non-formalized form
- L3 – The document is structured into identifiable sections (same as in L2), some information can be kept in formalized form, selected information will be kept in formalized and coded form

This page describes also the actors that have been defined for specifying the obligations.
